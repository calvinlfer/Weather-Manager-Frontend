# Weather Manager Frontend
A simple UI created using React and Redux that is meant to interact with the [Weather Manager API](https://github.com/calvinlfer/Weather-Manager). This makes use of Google Places API in order to perform the location autocompletion/suggestion and resolve coordinates (latitude and longitude)

### Getting Started
Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```
> git clone https://github.com/calvinlfer/Weather-Manager-Frontend.git
> cd Weather-Manager-Frontend
> npm install
> npm start
```

You need to signup for a [Google API key](https://console.developers.google.com) and make sure to enable the Places API. In [index.html](https://github.com/calvinlfer/Weather-Manager-Frontend/blob/master/index.html), replace the existing key with your new key.
